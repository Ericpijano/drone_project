# drone_project

this repository will capture the progress and relevant information regarding the creation of a "Do-It-Yourself Drone"

the drone that will be made in this project should be "easily" replicated and made by someone following this Repo


the goals of the project will be 
-conduct an engineering approach on a creation of a drone 
     - from materials selection to design decisions should be research backed
     - attached all relevant links and documents in support for the engineering decisions
- the drone must be open sourced and most of the components must be able to be 3D printed 
- the drone must have photo/video taking capabilities
- the drone must be a viable alternate on current consumer drones
     - it should possess the basic capabilities of a camara drone
        - time of flight 
        - safety protocols 
        -reliable performance
- additional goals will be further defined as the project progressed 


project deadline : 
!!! june 22 !!!

Project official Start:
!!! May 1st !!!

current progress :
- research of the filament material 
  - what filament type is best for drone manufacturing
