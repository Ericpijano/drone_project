# drone_project

**introduction**
This repository will capture the progress and relevant information regarding the creation of a "Do-It-Yourself Drone"
The drone that will be made in this project should be "easily" replicated and made by someone following this Repo


**The goals of the project will be**: 
- conduct an engineering approach on the creation of a drone 
     - from materials selection to design decisions should be research backed
     - attached all relevant links and documents in support for the engineering decisions
- the drone must be open sourced and most of the components must be able to be 3D printed 
- the drone must have photo/video taking capabilities
- the drone must be a viable alternate on current consumer drones
     - it should possess the basic capabilities of a camara consumer drone
        - time of flight 
        - safety protocols 
        - reliable performance
- the project should lay the foundation for learning different concepts 
     - the drone will be a "smart" drone. it must be programmable where future smart 
       systems can be integrated.
     - a raspberry pi will be used to be the flight controller , handling high level commands
     - ardupilot for software interface
- additional goals will be further defined as the project progressed 


**Project official Start**:

!!! May 1st !!!

**Project deadline**: 

!!! june 22 !!!

**Skills will be learned**
- AI generative design using Fusion360 for optimal strength/stiffness of 
  drone frame

**Current progress**:
- research of the filament material 
  - what filament type is best for drone manufacturing 
     - so far leaning towards TPU / ABS
